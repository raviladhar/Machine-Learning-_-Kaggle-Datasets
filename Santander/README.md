Worked on Santander-customer-transaction-prediction applied three different prediction approaches Logistic Regression, Decsion Tree and the Random Forest, where the Logistic Regression performed well and the accuracy is around 0.77691. I used the python library Sklearn to apply machine learning concepts.

The Data is taken from the Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview
In this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.
